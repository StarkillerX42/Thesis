\chapter{APS Features}
\label{apschap}
The apsthesis class is similar to CU's standard thesis class, with some nice
 modifications. In structure, it resembles the CU standard, but in features
 and symbols, it's very similar to the aasjournal class. Useful symbols include:

 $\earth$

 $\sun$

 $\arcsec$

 $\degr$

 \apj, and many more.
