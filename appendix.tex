\chapter{Project Code}
In the creation of this thesis, over 2000 lines of code were written. In the
 interest of academic transparency and review, this code is made public and free
 to anyone interested in reviewing it. All work was done in Python 3.6, either
 as a library or via Jupyter Notebooks. The main data pipeline is contained in
 PSG.py, while the analysis and figures were created in Jupyter Notebooks, and
 can be reproduced interactively there.

All the project code is available on a GitHub repository, which can be found at
 \url{https://github.com/StarkillerX42/GatlinPSG}. The results produced here
 would require the climate models produced by Eric Wolf, which are also publicly
 available at
